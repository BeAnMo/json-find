Go back and check over it again after you finished, to make sure you did everything.  *Nobody* puts extraneous information in the spec or ticket.  You're much more likely to not have enough information than to have enough, and ridiculously unlikely to have too much information.\n\nFollow the process.  If a company has a process, it's because they've had problems in the past and the worked out the kinks.  This is especially true for smaller companies.\n\nExcept for emergencies, there is very little that is as important as clean, readable, understandable, maintainable code.  \n\nIf you fix the problem, but cause the problem or make it so confusing that it creates problems later, you haven't actually fixed the problem.a\n\nIf your goal is a close tickets, you are screwing over the company and the entire rest of your team.  Your goal should be to fix problems.\n\nIf you see a problem along the way, either fix it and report it, or report it.  Which of those paths you choose will depend on how complicated that fix is, and how unrelated it is to the current ticket.\n\nBefore you call your code done, read over *all* of it again with a critical eye.  If anything confuses you or could be improved, fix it.\n\nIt might sound like I didn't give you advice about how to code, but I assure you the above is more important than the actual coding and it *will* shape how you code things.\n\nBut your actual process for solving a problem will be personal to you.  Trying to do it other peoples' ways will be a lot less enlightening than you hope.",

This is especially true for smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for emergencies, there is very little that is as important as clean, readable, understandable, maintainable code.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you fix the problem, but cause the problem or make it so confusing that it creates problems later, you haven&amp;#39;t actually fixed the problem.a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your goal is a close tickets, you are screwing over the company and the entire rest of your team.  Your goal should be to fix problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see a problem along the way, either fix it and report it, or report it.  Which of those paths you choose will depend on how complicated that fix is, and how unrelated it is to the current ticket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you call your code done, read over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it again with a critical eye.  If anything confuses you or could be improved, fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might sound like I didn&amp;#39;t give you advice about how to code, but I assure you the above is more important than the actual coding and it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; shape how you code things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your actual process for solving a problem will be personal to you.  Trying to do it other peoples&amp;#39; ways will be a lot less enlightening than you hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Make sure the main code is readable from top to bottom like a story. It\u2019s helpful for yourself to know what exactly a function does or why a variable is implemented, but also for co-workers on the project.

Web tech moves so quickly it can feel like you're always way behind. You're not. Keep learning but understand you can accomplish something a million different ways and chances are none of them are bad.\n\nAlways comment decisions in the codebase, explain *why* something was done in a particular way. Don't expect someone to find a random word doc somewhere explaining decision making. Don't leave technical decisions undocumented expecting other people to spend time and effort trying to decipher what was going on in your head. Don't add pointless comments but that doesn't mean no comments.\n\nIt's ok to have a total mental block. Programming is as much of an art as it is a science - you spend your days dreaming up how to make virtual machines and then trying to put that down on paper/screen. Sometimes your brain just won't cooperate at which point you're screwed. Don't panic, it will start up again once you accomplish a tiny little task first. It needs a jump start once in a while.\n\nBefore you start tackling your problem, it helps to grab pen and paper and sketch out what you are trying to achieve. Implementing new features especially benefit from sketches. And helps communicates your abstract thoughts to team members.\n\nDon't get too caught up in trying to do everything the right way. Most code isn't mission critical, lives don't depend on it, take advantage of that to prioritise what matters.\n\nFit your code style into the codebase's existing style. If it looks like a messy codebase show gradual changes rather than a maverick mega-change that nobody else understands. The codebase is a journey, however messy, it's clearly good enough to give you a job. Take pride in the code you write, grammar matters, spelling matters. The shape/layout of your code matters. And use line breaks!\n\nDo try and figure out how to programatically test your code. No matter how great a programmer you are you will introduce bugs with pretty much every other line of code you write. Your test code will be several times bigger than your actual code and will take far longer than you would like. But it's as much a programming task as the actual problem/feature is.\n\nHelp and encourage other team members. Share things you've learned, take others with you. It will make you even better at your craft.",

It needs a jump start once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you start tackling your problem, it helps to grab pen and paper and sketch out what you are trying to achieve. Implementing new features especially benefit from sketches. And helps communicates your abstract thoughts to team members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get too caught up in trying to do everything the right way. Most code isn&amp;#39;t mission critical, lives don&amp;#39;t depend on it, take advantage of that to prioritise what matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fit your code style into the codebase&amp;#39;s existing style. If it looks like a messy codebase show gradual changes rather than a maverick mega-change that nobody else understands. The codebase is a journey, however messy, it&amp;#39;s clearly good enough to give you a job. Take pride in the code you write, grammar matters, spelling matters. The shape/layout of your code matters. And use line breaks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do try and figure out how to programatically test your code. No matter how great a programmer you are you will introduce bugs with pretty much every other line of code you write. Your test code will be several times bigger than your actual code and will take far longer than you would like. But it&amp;#39;s as much a programming task as the actual problem/feature is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Help and encourage other team members. Share things you&amp;#39;ve learned, take others with you. It will make you even better at your craft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Once you actually learn to respect end-users, it gets a lot easier.\n\nEven buggy code with a good UI and error handling can be better than clean code that expects to live in a perfect world. I 100% will not hesitate to increase software complexity if that's what it takes to handle user errors and unreliable networks.

Does your use of Tiermann's First order Polymeric Transform(Not a real thing) make anything faster?  Will it  help me port this later?  Does it enable some cool new feature?  Does it reduce bugs?\n\nIf not, I don't care.   If you've tweaked and tuned and debugged and got everything to be just perfect, down to ten lines with a recursive higher order function, I literally will not care.\n\nIf you did it at home and blogged about it, I would think it was cool(As long as you didn't pretend that kind of thing is going to carry over to real life projects), but if I have to deal with it, I'll be annoyed I had to wait for you to write it, then annoyed that I had to read it.\n\n\n\n\nYou probably can't do better than a standard library. And if you can, you probably don't have time.  And if you do, you'll still need to justify that it had real benefits, because, as previously mentioned, it's not about code, and the community behind the standards is worth more than a slight bit of extra code quality, unless you can show real benefit.\n\nEven copy and pasting saves time, and most of the time, the thing you're copying is very obvious.  Why bother reinventing? If this is an educational drill... When do the real projects start?\n\n\nAnd maybe most importantly, nobody is going to use your amazing new framework unless you can seriously support it.  Maybe it's better than anything that came before, and will inspire a few.   But a lot of the people who would care, have their *own* amazing new framework.  And the practically minded won't look beyond the word \"new\", and will read it as \"untested trash full of undocumented behavior that the author learned to work around isn't going to fix\".\n\nIn interpersonal growth there's the idea of \"listening to understand\" vs \"listening to reply\".  Be honest with yourself about what others are really going to be doing.  You can fart the world's best fart, but the other fartists will prefer their own.\n\n\nLook at things from a high level.  What do the trusted solutions that people love do?  What are people complaining about? Do the successful projects use original code or libraries? What kinds of changes are likely to create a nightmare of bugs?\n\nUnless you're formally proving things, the high level decisions of coding aren't math or science, they're art.  Theory and blog posts don't replace understanding the application and providing value of users.\n\n\nWhich reminds me, programming blogs all say the same 10 oversimplified things, usually about the virtues of oversimplifying things.  If you're reading this, you should probably be reading about a quarter the amount of programming content you actually do.\n\nDo you know how to program? Great. Keep doing that and you'll get better, till you decide to change careers.   \n\nYou don't need to sacrifice your whole life at a glowing rectangular pixel shrine, doing code katas all weekend.  You certainly don't need to do competitive coding. And if you do choose to do those, remember that your ultra clever one liners and obscure patterns are just one more nonstandard thing for the maintainers to learn.\n\n\nAnd finally, if you gain enough respect that people care about your opinion, you almost certainly WILL have to defend the projects you work on from people who want to make the whole codebase their personal splashy fun times pool of Haskell and Lisp metaprogramming, microservices, and custom build tools, and they might not even know Haskell yet(!).  That someone might even be you, and that project might be a website about coin collecting.\n\nThink really hard about what the actual benefits are.  Maybe there's something to gain by having everyone learn a new language on the clock.   Or maybe, this is a two-person job and you shouldn't make real paid projects into testing grounds, when they should be very simple and easy.\n\nDon't invent more work just because you're bored.  Get the task done, and go learn Haskell on your own time, or suggest your boss set aside a few hours for everyone to learn whatever it is.  But make sure you never wind up with a project full of super cool tech that only one person understands, just because you couldn't say no.",

If your function takes too many parameters, use a structure or an object that's more understandable.\n\n\\- In the same vein, avoid boolean parameters.

Write good commits, learn how to branch, master your IDE (and make it yours), learn how to build and publish.\n\n\\- Already said, but it's super important: Don't. Write. Smart. Code. I had a colleague who was (and still is I guess) super intelligent and competent, but who was a pain to work with because his code was truly his alone. He took pride in the complexity of his craft, or the abstraction and modularity of his code. And nobody was able to 100% decipher his shit.\n\n\\- Learn how and when to ask for help. Don't spend too much time banging your head alone on an issue, but do try to solve it, show what you've tried, and how that failed. Never come empty-handed.\n\n\\- Don't try to solve future problems. More code = more bugs, more work, more maintenance. If you need to re-write some code because some requirements or constraints evolved, then rewrite it.\n\n\\- Learn how to speak with business people. They often have X/Y problems, so don't blindly do X, because it'll come back bite you in the ass sooner or later.",

Write. Smart. Code. I had a colleague who was (and still is I guess) super intelligent and competent, but who was a pain to work with because his code was truly his alone. He took pride in the complexity of his craft, or the abstraction and modularity of his code. And nobody was able to 100% decipher his shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Learn how and when to ask for help. Don&amp;#39;t spend too much time banging your head alone on an issue, but do try to solve it, show what you&amp;#39;ve tried, and how that failed. Never come empty-handed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Don&amp;#39;t try to solve future problems. More code = more bugs, more work, more maintenance. If you need to re-write some code because some requirements or constraints evolved, then rewrite it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Learn how to speak with business people. They often have X/Y problems, so don&amp;#39;t blindly do X, because it&amp;#39;ll come back bite you in the ass sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Effective communication between people, be it stakeholders, team members, customers/clients is both the most complex and important component to your software. Read the documentation. RFC specs too. (English is the defacto standard for software, just living with the facts).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't trust your long term memory and value your time; you will forget practically everything and the cognitive load of recall on an obfuscated code base is extraordinarily expensive. Write as though it's not for you, it's for your forgetful future self or someone else that has no time to fix a critical issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComments are lies with good intentions. Good code is so obvious, it speaks for itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCode rots, is disposable and deprecates the moment it goes to production. Whenever possible, let someone else do the work - quality 3rd parties have more resources to maintain than you do, your wheel is not special. On the balance, there is more value to code you've deleted than contributed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPay attention to how software is made. As a senior, you set the path and point, then your role is support: you are guiding your team along your path from the back of the line.

Written and spoken communication - in English - is arguably the most important language in your programming career. Effective communication between people, be it stakeholders, team members, customers/clients is both the most complex and important component to your software. Read the documentation. RFC specs too. (English is the defacto standard for software, just living with the facts).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t trust your long term memory and value your time; you will forget practically everything and the cognitive load of recall on an obfuscated code base is extraordinarily expensive. Write as though it&amp;#39;s not for you, it&amp;#39;s for your forgetful future self or someone else that has no time to fix a critical issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comments are lies with good intentions. Good code is so obvious, it speaks for itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Code rots, is disposable and deprecates the moment it goes to production. Whenever possible, let someone else do the work - quality 3rd parties have more resources to maintain than you do, your wheel is not special. On the balance, there is more value to code you&amp;#39;ve deleted than contributed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to how software is made. As a senior, you set the path and point, then your role is support: you are guiding your team along your path from the back of the line. Picking up the pieces that fall through and carrying the weight that is left over. Knowing how to set up this path so it is smooth sailing for your team is the combined wisdom and skill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Yes, you 100% should be extremely cognizant of naming variables well, naming methods well, so on and so forth.  All of that is absolutely great advice that you should always, without exception, follow.\n\nBut, it is in no way, shape or form a substitute for good commenting.  They go hand-in-hand.\n\nSome people like to say that comments lie.  Yes, sometimes they do - but that's a direct result of developers who don't treat comments with the level of importance they should.  They believe comments are secondary to code and treat them as an afterthought.  And, to the extent that code is what executes, not comments, that obviously is true, they don't matter as much as the code.  But, if you focus on writing good comments as much as you focus on writing good code... and a big part of that is updating the comments each and every time you touch the code in such a way that makes the comment lie... then it doesn't happen.  It takes discipline and attention to detail and, newsflash, way too many developers don't like either of those things.\n\nSome people say you should only comment the why and not the how.  Well, that's MOSTLY true, but here's the thing: when you have to maintain software that you've never seen before or that you haven't seen in a while, and/or in technologies you don't know well or haven't used in a long time, the how is very useful to see documented too.  There's this unspoken conceit with developers that expects everyone else to be at the same level as them and if they're not then fuck them.  Few admit it, but you can see that attitude everywhere.\n\nBut, here's the thing: when you're talking about long-term maintainability - code that lasts for many years or even decades - there will undoubtedly be less-capable developers mucking about in the code at some point.  So, you have a choice: do you do everything you can to help them, or everything you can to fuck them?  What kind of developer - shit, what kind of PERSON - do you want to be?  I prefer to be one that helps as much as possible.  Comments are a big part of that because documentation tends to be an afterthought with developers when they're separate entities.  Comments, however, if not ignored out of some misguided desire to keep the code \"clutter-free\", are right there with the code and will naturally get more attention (if you aren't fundamentally anti-commenting).\n\nBasically, the people that say \"only comment non-obvious code\" are defining what is \"obvious\".  Err on the side of things being NOT obvious if there's ANY doubt at all.  You should be trying to NOT write clever code in the first place - another big problem - but just because you think a particular line isn't particular clever and makes total sense doesn't mean the next guy will.  Assume he won't, and try and help him out, even if you ARE commenting about the how of the code.\n\nultimately, some people will also say that there is good commenting and there is bad commenting.  I agree with that completely.  Good comments generally don't say what the code plainly does.  But, here's the thing: what is \"plain\" to you may not be plain to the next person, or even you at some point in the future.  Err on the side of writing \"bad\" comments, those that are obvious, redundant, \"pointless\".  Obviously, you should always be challenging yourself to make sure the comments actually do add value.  All I'm saying is that if it's debatable, prefer adding a \"pointless\" comment than adding none at all.  If nothing else, it can verify that what the code says was the actual intent.",

Learn what side effects are, how to manage them, and keep them at the edges when possible.\n\nLearn to think of software as pipes that pump data, rather than a complex factory that does a bunch of crap.  Research and practice these concepts until you understand how functional programming, side effects, and looking at code as data pipes vs complex machinery are intrinsically related.  \n\nLearn more programming languages, even stuff that seems \u201cuseless\u201d (like Haskell).  Clojure and Haskell entirely changed the way I write other code (for the better).  Not everything needs to be a class.  \n\nLook at shared global state as a code smell.

Or, if you\u2019re in a pair programming shop, pay close attention to the unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help thinking you\u2019re just supposed to know something.  Everyone gets stuck and nobody knows everything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t be the only one that possesses subject matter expertise on something.  Spread your knowledge around.  If you\u2019re the \u201cgoto guy\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself always working on your days off, vacations, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always think about the big picture.  Data flows in a pipeline.  Consider the upstream and downstream impact of any code you write.  If you can\u2019t, work to fill your knowledge gaps until you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who has spent time on both sides of the desk, I can tell you that good developers write exactly to the specs, even if the specs are wrong.  Great developers ask questions and seek out answers.  Don\u2019t be afraid to be a pest.  If you see something, say something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
